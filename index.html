<hr>
<p><b>Modern University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1636 as 
Modern College and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John, it is the oldest institution 
of higher learning in the United States and among the most prestigious in the world.<img src="img.jpg" align="right"></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The university is composed of ten academic faculties plus the Radcliffe Institute for 
Advanced Study. Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of academic disciplines for 
undergraduates and for graduates, while the other faculties offer only graduate degrees, 
mostly professional.has three main campuses:the 209-acre 
Cambridge campus centered on Cambridge Yard; an adjoining campus immediately across the 
Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical campus in Boston's 
Longwood Medical Area.endowment is valued at $53.2 billion, making it the 
largest of any academic institution. Endowment income helps enable the undergraduate 
college to admit students regardless of financial need and provide generous financial aid 
with no loans. The Modern university Library is the world's largest academic library system,
 comprising 79 individual libraries holding about 20.4 million items</p>

 <br>
 <p>University owns the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, D.C., 
 the Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts, the Concord Field Station in Estabrook 
 Woods in Concord, Massachusetts,the Villa I Tatti research center in Florence, Italy,
 the Harvard Shanghai Center in Shanghai, China, and the Arnold Arboretum in the Jamaica Plain 
 neighborhood of Boston.</p>

 <p>The Massachusetts colonial legislature authorized University founding, "dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches, when our 
 present ministers shall lie in the dust"; though never formally affiliated with any denomination, in its early years Modern College 
 primarily trained Congregational clergy.
 Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century, 
 it had emerged as the central cultural establishment among the Boston elite. Following the American Civil War,
 President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869-1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional 
 schools into a modern research university; Modern University became a founding member 
 of the Association of American Universities in 1900. James B. Conant led the university through the Great 
 Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.</b></p>

The Yard contains administrative offices such as University Hall and Massachusetts Hall; libraries such as Widener, Pusey,
 Houghton, and Lamont; and Memorial Church.</p>
 <p>Academic buildings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including the college, such as Sever Hall and university Hall.</p>
<p>Freshman dormitories are in, or adjacent to, the Yard. Upperclassmen live in the twelve residential houses
 “ nine south of the Yard near the Charles River, the others half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Radcliffe
 Quadrangle (which formerly housed Radcliffe College students). Each house is a community of undergraduates, 
 faculty deans, and resident tutors, with its own dining hall, library, and recreational facilities</p><img src="pro.jpg" align="right">
 <p>Also in Cambridge are the Law, Divinity (theology), Engineering and Applied Science, Design (architecture), 
 Education, Kennedy (public policy), and Extension schools, 
 as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Radcliffe Yard. Harvard also has 
 commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge.</p>
 <br>
 <h2>Allston</h2>
 <p><img src="mic.jpg" width="280px">Modern Business School, Modern Innovation Labs, and many athletics facilities, including 
 University Stadium, are located on a 358-acre campus in Allston, a Boston neighborhood just across the Charles 
 River from the Cambridge campus. 
 The John W. Weeks Bridge, a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River, connects the two campuses.</p>
 <p>The university is actively expanding into Allston, where it now owns more land than in Cambridge.
 Plans include new construction and renovation for the Business School, a hotel and conference center, 
 graduate student housing, Harvard Stadium, and other athletics facilities.</p>
 <p>In 2021, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will expand into a 
 new, 500,000+ square foot Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) in Allston. The SEC will be adjacent
 to the Enterprise Research Campus, the Business School, and the Harvard Innovation Labs to encourage 
 technology- and life science-focused startups as well as collaborations with mature companies.</p>
